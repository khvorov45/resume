<ul>
  <li>
    Transform vertices from model space to world space to camera space to clip space (on the GPU this would be the main part of the vertex shader, clip space 4D coordinates being the output).
  </li>
  
  <li>Perform back-face culling (GPU internal)</li>

  <li>Perform frustrum clipping (GPU internal)</li>

  <li>Do perpective division to get 3D normalized device coordinates (GPU internal)</li>
