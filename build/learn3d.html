					Software 3d renderer
				</h1>
				<p>
					A software 3d renderer I wrote in Odin following 
					<a href="https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming">
						"Learn 3d graphics programming from scratch"
					</a>
					course by Gustavo Pezzi.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can draw textured models (exported as .obj) on the CPU by following steps similar to
				what GPUs do in shaders and internally:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Transform vertices from model space to world space to camera space to clip space
				(on the GPU this would be the main part of the vertex shader, clip space 4D coordinates being the output).
					</li>
					<li>
						Perform back-face culling (GPU internal).
					</li>
					<li>
						Perform frustrum clipping (GPU internal)
					</li>
					<li>
						Do perpective division to get 3D normalized device coordinates (GPU internal).
					</li>
					<li>
						Iterate through the resulting triangles and figure out which pixles to fill (GPU internal).
					</li>
					<li>
						Iterate through the pixels of each triangle and figure out what its color should be (pixel shader).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Has some extra features not covered in the course:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Following the top-left fill rule (or at least trying to).
					</li>
					<li>
						Bilinear texture filtering.
					</li>
					<li>
						Timings.
					</li>
					<li>
						Debug UI.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mouse support for camera control.
					</li>
					<li>
						Custom windows platform code (no SDL).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Some things Gustavo said in that course are likely wrong:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Gaps in polygons. While his code wasn't following the top-left fill rule,
			he was forcing all the triangles to be aligned to the pixel grid, so I don't think
			it's actually possible to have gaps between adjacent triangles then. Not following a fill rule
			will result in some pixels being covered by more than one triangle, but there should be no gaps.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fetching outside the texture. He didn't correctly identify the cause of it in his code which was floating
			point error accumulation. There was a float he kept adding to every iteration of a loop while filling pixels of
			a triangle. When I switched to always having the same starting float and adding iteration number times the increment,
			fetching outside the texture problem went away.
					</li>
				</ul>
